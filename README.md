# Rice Species Classification Machine Learning Project

This project builds a binary classifier to distinguish between **Arborio** and **Jasmine** rice varieties using machine learning. The work is part of a machine learning course assignment.

## 📁 Repo Contents
- `data/`: Dataset (Arborio vs Jasmine rice images/features)
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code, EDA, model building, and evaluation
- `report.pdf`: Detailed project report (methodology, results, analysis)
- `README.md`: This file

## 🚀 Overview
- **Task**: Classify rice species using morphological features
- **Models Tested**: *k-NN*, *Naïve Bayes*, *Gradient Boosting*
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable)
3. Run `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter
